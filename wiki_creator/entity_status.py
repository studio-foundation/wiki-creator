"""Decide whether a character is dead by the end of this tome.

The `status` infobox slot has been declared and inert since STU-504. Filling it
needs the one thing a regex cannot give: who a sentence is *about*. STU-538
measured that lesson at 340 fires and 0 true positives — a pattern matched in one
entity's context was credited to whichever entity happened to be paired with it.
"Eragon watched Brom die" holds a death marker in both characters' contexts and
kills exactly one of them.

So the marker vocabulary only **retrieves**: it picks which snippets the
classifier reads. The classifier decides. A marker missing from the vocabulary
means a death is never surfaced, which means `unknown` — the forgiving direction.

Every helper here fails toward `unknown`. The asymmetry is STU-539's: a false
`deceased` kills a living character on a page nobody will reread, while a false
`unknown` renders the slot's own declared fallback.
